# Firebase Console

### Install

```bash
yarn add -D ferleal/firebase-console
```
### Setup
- Generate a service account from within the settings section of the Firebase console

- Save the service account to serviceAccount.json within your firebase project repo (or set SERVICE_ACCOUNT environment variable)

- Make sure you add serviceAccount.json to your .gitignore so it is not committed as part of your changes - THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
